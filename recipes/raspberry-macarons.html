        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <!--steps (ordered)-->
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li>Add egg whites to a <em>clean</em> large glass or metal mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate for
                    24 hours before bringing to room temperature.</li></p>

                <p>
                    <li>Take electric mixer and beat aged egg whites until they build volume and the beaters leave tracks.
                    Add superfine sugar slowly, in 3 parts, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. If using
                    gel coloring, add 1-2 drops in the whites now and beat with low speed until color is evenly mixed in. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Sift almond flour and confectioners' sugar before adding to a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Slowly fold in the stiff egg whites to the dry mix, in 3 parts, until throughly incorporated. 
                    It is vital to go slow; be very careful not to overmix.</li>
                    <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Spoon macaron batter into piping bag with medium round piping tip.
                    Pipe batter in 2-inch rounds onto parchment paper. Leave about 2 inches between rounds. After, bang pan 
                    several times to pop air bubbles. Let sit out for 30-60 minutes, or only until macarons' surfaces are dry.</li></p>

                <p>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325°F.</li>
                    <li>Bake the macarons for 13 minutes, or until they are completely dry. Let the shells cool on baking sheet before
                    removing parchment paper.</li></p>

                <p>
                    <li>Blend raspberries in food processor for about 3-4 minutes until seeds are completely crushed.</li>
                    <li>Transfer raspberry purée to saucepan over medium heat. Add white chocolate bits and using a wooden spoon,
                    stir slowly until chocolate has melted.</li>
                    <li>Set the raspberry-chocolate filling aside to cool before refrigerating for 1 hour.</li></p>
                
                <p>
                    <li>Spoon filling to a piping bag. Pipe and fill a macaron shell before topping with another shell. Repeat with
                    remaining shells. Once macarons are all filled, refrigerate for 24 hours before serving.</li></p>
