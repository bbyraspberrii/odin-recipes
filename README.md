# odin-recipes

This project is to create a homepage consisting of links to three recipes. Each recipe has it's own page, therefore we will have three links.

There are four pages in total.

Skills I have demonstrated:
- created a homepage via index.html and linked each recipes using "a" elements with href, target, and rel attributes. 
- implenting html boilerplate for each html file.
- created different headings with "h1" and "h3" elements.
- created paragraph breaks with "p" element.
- created unordered ingredient lists using "ul" tags with "li" tags.
- created ordered steps lists using "ol" tags and "li" tags.
- added images to all four pages using "img" tags with src, and alt attribute. 
- used "em" and "strong" elements for emphasis.
- created comments to structure page and to keep code easy to read. 
- operated from command line to create empty pages using "touch".
- operated from command line using git add, git commit, git push to stage commits and push to github.
- operated from command line using  git log, git status to check current logs and status.
- operated from command line using  git commit --amend to edit previous commit.
- operated from command line to organize files using mv, rm, ls, mkdir, cd ., cd .., cd --, cd ~, etc.
